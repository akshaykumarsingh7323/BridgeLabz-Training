```
BridgeLabz-Training/
│── core-java-practice/
│ │── gcr-codebase/
│ │ │── arrays/
│ │ │── control-flow/
│ │ │── extras/
│ │ │── methods/
│ │ │── programming-elements/
│ │ │── program-prerequisites/
│ │ │── strings/
│ │── leet-code-codebase/
│ │── scenario-based-codebase/
│── README.md
```

- Learned basic Git commands (`init`, `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`).
